# HotDocs: Quickstart

There are 2 ways to get started with HotDocs:
- <%= link_to "Embed HotDocs in an already existing Rails application", embedded_path %>
- <%= link_to "Create a new Rails application for your docs", standalone_path %>

If you are in doubt, embed if you already have an app, otherwise create a new one.

Switching from one to the other is easy, so keep it simple!
